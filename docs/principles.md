# ParTecK DAO Principles
ParTecK DAO is an experiment in facilitating group decision-making in loosely defined communities. It should operate with the following principles in mind:

## 1. Technological expertise should not be a barrier to participation in a community.
Technology can only encourage participation in a community if the members of the community are comfortable using the technology.
The ParTecK DAO should be usable by participants who have no knowledge of the underlying technology, and should not require them to learn about the underlying technology.
The ParTecK DAO should be usable with standard devices such as laptops and smartphones running standard software. It should not require that community members obtain specialized hardware or software.
The ParTecK DAO should be usable entirely through the web.

## 2. Many forms of participation in a community are valuable and should be encouraged.
The ParTecK DAO does not encourage any particular form of interacting with the community. Online and offline contributions are both important and play a role in a community's success.
Different modes of participation allow a diverse group of people to bring their skills and knowledge to the community. Incentivizing just one mode of participation could leave out people with different employment situations, living arrangements, family needs, health conditions, or other attributes that make certain kinds of participation impossible.
Different kinds of participation in a community have value. Attending events, organizing events, and even voting all have value to the community.

## 3. Long-term, ongoing participation in the community should be encouraged.
Institutional knowledge plays a critical role in the success of communities and organizations. Communities should incentivize participants who develop this kind of deep expertise, and should rely on that expertise once it is established.

## 4. Newcomers are vital to a community's long-term health and should be welcomed.
Newcomers to a community bring enthusiasm and new ideas. Without them, communities can lose their initial energy or stagnate. While newcomers need to learn how to effectively participate in the community, they should not feel excluded by an entrenched group of senior members.

## 5. Technology can augment a community's processes or trust within a community, but other rules, laws, or norms are also at play.
While a community can agree that decisions will be made using a technological system, and can even make use of the technological system a requirement in their bylaws, the technological systems still exist within the context of other rules, laws, or norms.
The decisions made using the technological system must often be implemented by humans.
The community itself exists within a framework of law and relationships between members.
