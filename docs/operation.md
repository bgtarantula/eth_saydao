## Establishing a Community
- Anyone can be the founding Member of a Community.
- Members of a Community decide who may participate in the Community and how.

## Membership
- Membership in a Community belongs to an individual.
- Each Member is given a code that can be used to receive Say for participating in Events or to Vote in Polls.
- A Member is added [HOW]
- A Member can be removed by a Supermajority.

## Events and Say
- Participation in Events is rewarded with Say, a cryptographic token that is used to determine how much influence a Member has in Polls.
- Communities decide what forms of participation in the Community count as Events by way of a Poll.
- Within 24 hours of the conclusion of an Event, the Supervisor will provide a list of Members who participated and will receive Say. Members have one week from the conclusion of an Event to challenge the list provided by the Supervisor.
    - Should this be social or require a vote by members? Supermajority - emergency shutdown.
- To allow newcomers to gain influence in the Community, each opportunity to participate in Events is rewarded with more Say than then last. (See inflation charts - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pEkx2UZKIDKZs9_eY0snoXh6tkB28-YjLGvqLJD9HSs/edit#gid=0)


## Opening a Poll
- Any Member of the Community with enough Say can open a Poll on any subject in accordance with the Community's rules.
- A Member must have Say to open a Poll.
- Polls must include a question to be answered by Members and a time limit for participation in the Poll.
- Polls to create Events must have a time limit of at least one week, and must nominate a Supervisor to record attendance in the Event for the purpose of awarding Say.

## Poll Results
- When the Poll is closed, the result of the Poll is made available to the Community in the same way the Poll was announced.
- A Poll requires a Quorum of 33% of either all Members or total Say.
- The Community can decide how to respond to the outcome of a Poll, in accordance with its rules.

## Adjusting Say
- The Community can Transfer a Member's Say by holding a Poll proposing the Transfer. [This is used if a Member loses their password and cannot Vote their Say.]
- The Community can Revoke a Member's Say by holding a Poll proposing the revocation. [This is used if a Member has shown themselves to be a bad actor and the Community wishes to take away the Member's ability to initiate or Vote in Polls.]
- A Poll to Transfer or Revoke is only successful with a Supermajority of a Quorum.
